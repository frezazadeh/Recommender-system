## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that recommends movies to users based on their past viewing history and preferences. Using the MovieLens dataset, the system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations through a machine learning model integrated into a REST API.

## Dataset Description

### Dataset Source

- **Dataset**: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)
- **Versions Used**: 
  - `ml-latest-small` (100k interactions for initial exploration)
  - `ml-latest` (larger dataset for full-scale model training and deployment)

### Key Features

- **Movies.csv**: Contains movie information (ID, title, genres).
- **Ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for movies (user ID, movie ID, rating, timestamp).

### Dataset Statistics

- Number of users: ~600 (small dataset), ~138k (large dataset)
- Number of movies: ~9k (small dataset), ~27k (large dataset)
- Number of ratings: ~100k (small dataset), ~20M (large dataset)

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Data Exploration

1. **Rating Distribution**: 
   - Most ratings cluster around 3.0-4.0, indicating a preference for mid-to-high ratings.
2. **User Activity**:
   - Few users rate a large number of movies, while most users rate a limited number.
3. **Genre Analysis**:
   - Popular genres include `Drama`, `Comedy`, and `Action`.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Missing Values**:
   - No missing values detected in core files (`movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`).
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Genre Encoding**: Genres are split into binary columns using one-hot encoding.
   - **User & Movie Mapping**: Unique user and movie IDs are mapped to indices for tensor compatibility.
3. **Data Splits**:
   - Train (80%), Validation (10%), Test (10%) splits are created with edge sampling to ensure no data leakage.

## Model Selection and Training

### Model Architecture

1. **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**:
   - **Base Model**: GraphSAGE-based GNN.
   - **Heterogeneous Graph**: Users and movies as node types; interactions as edge types.
   - **Movie Features**: Combined embeddings from movie genres and learned embeddings.
2. **Scorer**:
   - Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) scoring function to compute user-movie interaction probabilities.

### Training Pipeline

1. **Loss Function**:
   - Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss.
2. **Optimization**:
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate: `1e-3` and weight decay: `1e-5`.
3. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Hidden Channels: 32
   - Batch Size: 1024
   - Epochs: 5
   - Early Stopping: Patience of 30 epochs.

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics

1. **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Loss**:
   - Measures the model's ability to rank positive interactions higher than negative ones.
2. **Approximate AUC**:
   - Evaluates the quality of recommendations by comparing positive vs. negative scores.

### Results

| Metric         | Training | Validation | Test  |
|----------------|----------|------------|-------|
| BPR Loss       | 0.42     | N/A        | 0.45  |
| Approx. AUC    | N/A      | 0.89       | 0.87  |

## Deployment

### API Integration

1. **Framework**: FastAPI
2. **Endpoint**: `/recommend/`
   - Input: User ID and number of recommendations (`top_k`).
   - Output: List of recommended movies with genres and scores.

### Streamlit Dashboard

1. **Features**:
   - User ID input.
   - Adjustable number of recommendations.
   - Interactive display of recommendations with movie details.
2. **Setup**:
   - Run: `streamlit run app.py`
   - Backend API: Ensure the FastAPI server is running locally.

---

## Results and Insights

1. **Performance**:
   - The model achieves competitive BPR Loss and AUC scores, demonstrating effective personalized recommendations.
2. **Scalability**:
   - The pipeline scales to the larger MovieLens dataset with Spark for preprocessing.
3. **User Experience**:
   - The deployed Streamlit dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for movie discovery.

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Models**:
   - Experiment with Transformer-based architectures for capturing sequential user behavior.
2. **Cold-Start Problem**:
   - Introduce content-based filtering for users or movies with limited interaction history.
3. **Diversity and Fairness**:
   - Include metrics to ensure diverse and unbiased recommendations.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Leverage distributed training frameworks for real-time large-scale recommendation systems.
