# MovieLens Dataset Analysis

## 1. Data Overview

We are working with the MovieLens dataset, a widely used dataset in recommendation systems. It contains:

- **610 users**
- **9,724 movies**
- **100,836 ratings**
- **Average ratings per user:** 165.30
- **Average ratings per movie:** 10.37
- **Sparsity of the rating matrix:** 98.3%, meaning most movies do not have ratings from most users.

---

## 2. Rating Distribution

### Key Observations:

- The ratings are not uniformly distributed.
- Most users tend to give higher ratings, with **4.0 being the most common rating (26.6%)**, followed by **3.0 (19.88%)**.
- There are fewer low ratings (0.5, 1.0, 1.5), indicating that users are generally positive in their ratings.

### ðŸ“Š Plot Analysis (First Plot):

- The bar chart visualizes the frequency of each rating.
- The skew towards higher ratings suggests that users tend to rate movies positively.

### Potential Implications for Model:

- A recommendation system might over-recommend highly rated movies unless balanced with user preferences.
- Since the dataset lacks many negative ratings, a **binary classification approach (liked/disliked)** could be an alternative modeling approach.

## 3. Ratings per User

### Key Observations:

- The number of ratings per user follows a highly skewed distribution.
- Some users have rated only **20 movies**, while others have rated **over 2,600 movies**.
- The **median number of ratings per user is 70.5**, meaning half of the users have rated fewer than 71 movies.

### ðŸ“Š Plot Analysis (Second Plot):

- A long-tail distribution with a few users contributing most ratings.
- Most users rate fewer than 100 movies.
- The smooth curve (KDE) highlights the drop-off in rating activity.

### Potential Implications for Model:

- **Cold Start Problem:** Users with very few ratings make personalized recommendations difficult.
- A **user-based collaborative filtering approach** might struggle due to the uneven distribution of ratings.

## 4. Ratings per Movie

### Key Observations:

- Some movies are extremely popular, with over **300 ratings**.
- The majority of movies have very few ratings (**many with just 1 or 2 ratings**).
- The **median number of ratings per movie is 3**, meaning most movies are rarely rated.

### ðŸ“Š Plot Analysis (Third Plot):

- Similar to user ratings, movies follow a **long-tail distribution**.
- Popular movies like **The Matrix (1999), Star Wars (1977), and Shawshank Redemption (1994)** have the most ratings.
- Many movies have limited engagement, making it harder to recommend lesser-known ones.

### Potential Implications for Model:

- **Popular Bias:** Recommendation models might favor frequently rated movies over lesser-known ones.
- **Hybrid Models** combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering could help recommend lesser-known movies based on their features.

## 5. Most & Least Rated Movies

### ðŸ“Œ Top 10 Most Rated Movies:

- Classic, popular films like **The Matrix, Star Wars, and Forrest Gump** appear frequently.
- These movies tend to have **Action, Drama, and Sci-Fi** genres, indicating a user preference trend.

### ðŸ“Œ Top 10 Least Rated Movies:

- Movies with very few ratings are mostly **obscure, niche, or foreign films**.
- **Comedy and Drama** genres appear frequently among the least rated movies.

### Potential Implications for Model:

- **Cold Start Problem for Movies:** Many movies have too few ratings to make reliable predictions.
- **Using a hybrid recommendation model (collaborative + content-based filtering)** can improve recommendations.

## 6. Key Challenges Identified

ðŸ”¹ **Sparse Data:** 98.3% of the user-item matrix is empty. **Matrix factorization (SVD, ALS)** or **deep learning techniques (Neural Collaborative Filtering)** could improve recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ **Cold Start Problem:** New users and movies with very few ratings make it hard to generate meaningful recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ **Bias Towards Popular Movies:** The model might over-recommend popular movies unless mitigated by diversity-promoting techniques.

ðŸ”¹ **Skewed Rating Distribution:** Many ratings are clustered around **3.0-5.0**, which could make it harder to differentiate good recommendations from bad ones.

## 7. Next Steps

ðŸ“Œ **Feature Engineering:** Extract movie metadata (**genre, year, actors**) for content-based recommendations.
ðŸ“Œ **Model Selection:** Consider **Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization, Neural Networks)** combined with **Content-Based Filtering** for better recommendations.
ðŸ“Œ **Evaluation Metrics:** Use **RMSE, MAE, and Precision@K** to validate model effectiveness.
ðŸ“Œ **Handling Data Sparsity:** Implementing **item-based collaborative filtering** or **embedding-based deep learning models** could improve recommendations.
